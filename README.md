plaid

 
Plaid looks forward to working with the security community to find security vulnerabilities in order to keep our business and customers safe.
SLA
Plaid will make a best effort to meet the following SLAs for hackers participating in our program:
Time to first response (from report submit) - 5 business days
Time to triage (from report submit) - 10 business days
Time to bounty (from triage) - 10 business days
We’ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.
Disclosure Policy
Please refrain from public or third-party disclosure of vulnerabilities before the issue has been confirmed as remediated by Plaid.
Program Rules
Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.
Automated scanning against Plaid properties is not permitted.
Violation of any of the terms of this program, including guidelines around bounty submission formats, are grounds for removal from the bug bounty program.
Rewards
Our rewards are based on severity per CVSS (the Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard). Please note these are general guidelines, and that reward decisions are up to the discretion of Plaid. Creative findings may be awarded at a higher level than their severity at the discretion of Plaid.
| Critical (9.0 - 10.0) | High (7.0 - 8.9)  | Medium (4.0 - 6.9) | Low (0.1 - 3.9) |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
| $2,500 | $1,000 | $500 | $250 |
Out of scope vulnerabilities
When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider (1) attack scenario / exploitability, and (2) security impact of the bug. The following issues are considered out of scope:
Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.
Unauthenticated/logout/login CSRF.
Attacks requiring MITM
Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.
Comma Separated Values (CSV) injection without demonstrating a vulnerability.
Missing best practices in SSL/TLS configuration.
Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS).
Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS
User account enumeration
Vulnerabilities that require attackers to obtain another user's authenticated session, tokens, or physical access to their devices
Issues that depend on unpatched or outdated browsers or mobile platforms
Version disclosure, detailed error messages, and any other findings whose only security impact is ‘attacker reconnaissance’
SPF and email antispam 'hygiene' issues
Application 'hygiene' issues like cookie subdomain settings or security flags or missing security headers
Vulnerabilities as reported by automated tools without additional analysis as to how they're an issue.
Reports from automated scanners that have not been validated.
Version disclosure, detailed error messages, and any other findings whose only security impact is 'attacker reconnaissance'
Best practices concerns
Thank you for helping keep Plaid and our users safe!

RSK has created this bug bounty program to reward security researchers that dedicate time and effort to improve the RSK platform. 
SLA
RSK will make a best effort to meet the following SLAs for hackers participating in our program:
Time to first response (from report submit) - 2 business days
Time to triage (from report submit) - 2 business days
Time to bounty (from triage) - 10 business days
We’ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.
Disclosure Policy
Follow HackerOne's disclosure guidelines (https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines).
Public disclosure of a vulnerability makes it ineligible for a bounty. If the user reports the vulnerability to other security teams (e.g. Ethereum or ETC) but reports to RSK with considerable delay, then RSK may reduce or cancel the bounty.
Program Rules
Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps. If the report is not detailed enough to reproduce the issue, the issue will not be eligible for a reward.
Submit one vulnerability per report, unless you need to chain vulnerabilities to provide impact.
When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
Multiple vulnerabilities caused by one underlying issue will be awarded one bounty.
Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.
The submitter must be the person who has discovered the vulnerability. Vulnerability submission cannot be delegated.
The submitter grants RSK the right to use parts or all the submitted report for communicating the vulnerability to the public.
Only test on nodes that you own. Avoid testing that could be damaging to RSK infrastructure or other users.
RSK development team, employees and all other people paid by RSK , directly or indirectly, are not eligible for rewards.
A person who submitted a change in the RSK codebase is not eligible for rewards for vulnerabilities originating or triggered by the submitted change.
Rewards
Our rewards are based on severity per CVSS (the Common Vulnerability Scoring Standard). Please note these are general guidelines, and that reward decisions are up to the discretion of RSK.
| Critical (9.0 - 10.0) | High (7.0 - 8.9)  | Medium (4.0 - 6.9) | Low (0.1 - 3.9) |
|----------|--------|---------|------|
|  $7,000  | $3,000 | $1,000    | $750 |
Scope
Our bug bounty program spans end-to-end: from soundness of protocols (such as the blockchain consensus model, the wire and p2p protocols, proof of work, etc.) and protocol implementation. Classical client security as well as security of cryptographic primitives are also part of the program. Most JSON RPC methods and CSRF attacks against them are in scope.
Out of scope vulnerabilities
When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider (1) attack scenario / exploitability, and (2) security impact of the bug. The following issues are considered out of scope:
Findings related to the encryption or access control of the integrated wallet.
Attacks requirng physical access or local user level access to a user's device.
Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working Proof of Concept.
Denial of our service (DoS) not directly related to a flaw in the RSK code or environment.
JSON RPC personal module and methods: eth_newFilter, eth_blockFilter
Thank you for helping keep RSK's platform and users safe!

We are launching a Bug Bounty program for ICQ, starting with covering most significant vulnerabilities as a first step.
Therefore, at the first stage we invite the most experienced bug hunters and do not accept reports related to unexploitable bugs (e.g. Self-XSS) and violations of BCP, such as SSL configuration issues.
Scope
Server-side
icq.com
api.icq.net
bos.icq.net
rapi.icq.net
botapi.icq.net
files.icq.com 
wapi.icq.com
store.icq.com
search.icq.com
Web client
web.icq.com
Mobile clients
ICQ for Android
ICQ for iOS
Desktop clients
ICQ for Windows PC

Bruteforce attacks
HTTPS configuration issues on the web sites
Cookies without Secure/HTTPOnly flags
Clickjacking issues without security impact demonstrated, self-XSS, same site scripting, software version disclosure, CSRF without security impact, etc.
XSS/CSRF for *.icq.net
Login / logout CSRF
SPF / DMARC issues
The following reports are accepted, but not eligible for bounty:
Insecure data storage in client apps
Open redirects
Non-critical CSRF attacks (for example, setting language)
Text-only / image/ video web content injection without interface spoofing
Bounties
Example prices are:
RCE for any site in the scope above: $3000
File manipulation (LFR, RFI, XXE): $1500
SQLi or equivalent injection: $1500
XSS on web.icq.com: $250
CSRF on web.icq.com: $50-$150
Remote permanent (resistant to application restart) DoS against application: $250
Limitations
We will not pay a reward (and we will be really upset) if we detect:
- Physical tampering with icq.com data centers or offices
- Social engineering directed at the company's employees
- Breaking into the company's infrastructure and using the information obtained to report vulnerabilities
Please use your own accounts to conduct your research. Do not try to gain access to others' accounts or any confidential information.
Vulnerability disclosure
Vulnerability must be disclosed only with accordance with HackerOne disclosure policy.
Request for vulnerability disclosure must be filed via HackerOne report interface.
No vulnerability disclosure, including partial is allowed before vulnerability is disclosed on HackerOne.

The Internet Bug Bounty is offering rewards to security researchers who resolve critical vulnerabilities in core software that has a direct impact on Internet Freedom. Critical vulnerabilities in these scopes have widespread consequences to the internet community. Please review the scope section below on which scopes qualify for this program!
Bounty Qualification
Only Critical vulnerabilities that demonstrate unambiguous remote code execution are eligible under this program. Findings with alternative impact or severity are not in scope at this time.
Your Proof of Concept MUST demonstrate that remote exploitation can be easily, actively, and reliably achieved.
Only versions currently supported by the upstream project are eligible. Please verify your issue is present in a current release before submission.
The individual software maintainers have final decision on which issues constitute security vulnerabilities. The Panel will respect their decision, and we ask that you do as well. It's important to keep in mind that not all submissions will qualify for a bounty, and that the decision to award a bounty is entirely at the discretion of the Panel.
Submission Process
Disclose a previously unknown security vulnerability directly to the project maintainers. Findings that are privately disclosed to other parties or bounty programs before the project maintainers are not eligible.
Follow the disclosure process established by the project maintainers.
Clearly demonstrate the security vulnerability. Respect the time of the project volunteers as they cannot invest significant effort into incomplete reports. Low-quality reports may be disqualified.
Once a public security advisory has been issued, please submit a report here. You must not send us the details of the vulnerability until it has been validated, accepted, and publicly disclosed by the project maintainers.
If you believe there are other widely used technologies in which a vulnerability would have a widespread impact on Internet freedom (e.g. digital rights and access), please email panel@internetbugbounty.org with your suggestion(s).
